Kangana Nation - What's new in the latest version


   Version 3.1.7

   1. Easy Installation Wizard. Path Selection for the software.

   2. If it takes too much time to locate a destination path
      in extraction dialog folder tree, automatic search performed
      as user enters the path is cancelled. Lengthy search 
      in large folders could interfere with user input in this dialog.

      You can still force WinRAR to select the entered destination path
      in extraction dialog with "Display" button.
   
   3. Bugs fixed:
   
      a) the keyboard focus was not returned to "Settings/File list"
         dialog page after selecting the file list font.
      
      b) the user interface has been focus page interface.

      c) cache saving bugs fixed.
